    <h1 class="title">The 2025 Measles Outbreak: A Wake-Up Call</h1>
    <h3>The Spike We Can’t Ignore</h3>
    <p>
        In early 2025, measles cases began climbing rapidly across the United
        States. Week after week, the numbers kept rising — bringing back a virus
        once considered nearly eliminated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Texas at the Center of It All</h3>
    <p>
        By spring 2025, one state accounted for a disproportionate share of
        cases: Texas. The outbreak was not evenly spread — some counties were
        hit much harder than others
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Who Is Getting Sick?</h3>
    <p>
        Children are at the frontlines of this outbreak. Nearly half of all
        reported cases in Texas were among kids aged 0–17 — including infants
        too young to be vaccinated.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Vaccination Gap</h3>
    <p>
        This outbreak isn’t random. Over 90% of the people infected in Texas
        were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>How Did We Get Here?</h3>
    <p>
        Vaccines nearly wiped out measles after their introduction in 1963. But
        in recent years, MMR coverage has been slipping — below the threshold
        needed for herd immunity.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Impact: Lives Lost</h3>
    <p>
        Three children have died in this outbreak. All were under age 5. None
        were vaccinated. These were preventable deaths.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>The Herd Protects the Vulnerable</h3>
    <p>
        Measles is one of the most contagious viruses on earth — but it’s also
        entirely preventable. Vaccination doesn't just protect you. It protects
        babies, the immunocompromised, and your community
